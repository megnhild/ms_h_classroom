    <p>I have been teaching for 4 years. All of those years I have been at Southern High School. I love this school and the students here. I went to Georgetown College where I graduated with a Mathematics degree. Then I continued my education at the University of Louisville to get my Master's degree in Teaching. I have a passion for teaching Mathematics and I am a firm believer that any person is capable of learning math. My job is to make my students believe that and help them succeed.</p>
